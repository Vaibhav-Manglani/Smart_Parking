# Smart Parking Lot System
- In this project, you can mark and erase the parking spots initially and then when the video plays, a counter will keep track of the number of free spots out of all the marked regions. </br>
- I am using simple Image Processing tools and cvzone primarily for this project.

## How to run this on your machine :
1. Open the folder in PyCharm.
2. Install the cvzone library.
3. Run the pick.py file.
4. Pick the parking spots.
5. Run the main.py file.
6. A window will pop up playing the video, along with the marked spots, keeping a count of the free spots available.
